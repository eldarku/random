Stars are huge celestial bodies made mostly of hydrogen and helium that produce light and heat from the churning nuclear forges inside their cores. There are 9,096 stars visible to the naked eye in the entire sky.
To see more, you have to use a telescope to reveal stars fainter than your eyes can see. You can only see about 2,000 stars on a very dark night with the naked eye from any given place on Earth.
Star birth can take millions of years and create families of stars. Astronomers see examples of star formation in nebulae throughout our own Milky Way Galaxy and in many other galaxies.
The nuclear reaction that takes place in a hydrogen bomb is the same reaction that fuels stars.  One in four Americans believe that the sun orbits the Earth, rather than the other way around. People have found hidden significance in the movement of the stars for millenia.
